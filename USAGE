# Build & Run Hydrogym (Docker)

This project uses a custom Docker image based on Firedrake.

## 1. Build the Docker image (one-time)

From the directory containing the Dockerfile:

```
docker build -t firedrake-hydrogym .
```

## 2. Run the container:

```
docker run -it --name hydrogym -p 8888:8888 firedrake-hydrogym
```

If the container already exists:

```
docker start -i hydrogym
```

## 3a. Run Hydrogym demo

```
cd hydrogym/examples/demo
python3 run-transient.py
```

# Notes:

- Exit container with `exit`
- All dependencies are installed inside the Docker image
